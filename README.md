# Leander Rück  
AI Automation & Workflow Systems Designer (B2B, Germany)

I design and build AI-driven workflow systems that automate repetitive business processes.  
My focus is on structured process analysis, API integration and the practical use of generative AI models to reduce manual information work in small and medium-sized businesses.

## What I Do

I analyze existing administrative and information-based workflows, break them down into technical components and rebuild them as automated, AI-supported systems.

Typical use cases include:

- Email classification and automated task routing  
- Invoice and document data extraction (PDF → structured JSON)  
- Contract and text analysis with risk flagging  
- Structured data generation from unstructured inputs  
- AI-assisted internal knowledge systems  

The objective is measurable efficiency gains, lower manual workload and reproducible system behavior.

## How I Work

My approach follows a structured architecture model:

Trigger → Processing → AI Layer → Structured Output → Storage → Monitoring

Every system is designed to be:

- Transparent  
- Modular  
- Maintainable  
- Scalable  

I prioritize structured outputs (JSON schemas), clear validation logic and defined integration points to ensure reliability and long-term usability.

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- REST APIs  
- Generative AI APIs  
- Workflow Automation Systems  
- JSON-based data modeling  
- Git-based version control  

## Current Focus

I am building and documenting practical AI automation systems for B2B environments, with emphasis on reproducible setups, clear documentation and professional system architecture.

All projects include defined problem statements, architectural explanations and structured output examples.
